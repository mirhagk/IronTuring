Iron Turing
====

Note
---

This is a legacy project (from ~5 years ago) that was a Turing compiler. The current goal is to clean this project up, apply some better coding practices (17 year old Nathan wasn't very good at best practices) and perhaps fix/complete it to the point that it's usable as a Turing compiler.
